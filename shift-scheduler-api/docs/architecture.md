# Architecture Documentation for Shift Scheduler API

## Overview

The Shift Scheduler API is designed to manage employee scheduling efficiently. It follows a clean architecture approach, separating concerns into distinct layers: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation. This document outlines the architecture of the system, including its components and their interactions.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Domain Layer

The Domain layer contains the core business logic and entities of the application. It is responsible for defining the fundamental concepts of the system.

- **Entities**: 
  - `Employee`: Represents an employee with properties such as id, name, and role.
  - `Shift`: Represents a work shift with properties such as id, startTime, and endTime.
  - `WorkSchedule`: Represents the schedule of an employee, linking them to shifts.
  - `Store`: Represents a point of sale with properties such as id, name, and location.

- **Value Objects**:
  - `TimeSlot`: Represents a time range for shifts.
  - `WorkDay`: Represents a working day, including date and associated shifts.
  - `EmployeeId`: A unique identifier for employees.

- **Repositories**: Interfaces for data access, including methods for CRUD operations on entities.

### 2. Application Layer

The Application layer contains the use cases and services that orchestrate the business logic. It acts as a bridge between the Domain layer and the Presentation layer.

- **Use Cases**:
  - `CreateEmployee`: Logic for creating a new employee.
  - `AssignShift`: Logic for assigning a shift to an employee.
  - `GetSchedule`: Logic for retrieving an employee's work schedule.
  - `ManageShifts`: Logic for managing shifts.

- **Services**: Common services used across the application, facilitating interactions between use cases and repositories.

### 3. Infrastructure Layer

The Infrastructure layer handles the technical details of the application, including database access and external integrations.

- **Persistence**: 
  - Sequelize models for each entity, defining the structure and relationships in the database.
  - Repositories implementing the interfaces defined in the Domain layer using Sequelize.

- **Database**: Configuration and setup for the database connection using Sequelize.

- **External Services**: Integration with any external APIs or services.

### 4. Presentation Layer

The Presentation layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. It defines the API endpoints and manages the interaction with clients.

- **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests and return responses. Each controller corresponds to a specific entity (e.g., Employee, Shift, WorkSchedule, Store).

- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects that define the structure of data sent to and from the API.

- **Validators**: Middleware for validating incoming request data to ensure it meets the required format and constraints.

- **Routes**: Define the API endpoints and map them to the appropriate controllers.

## Conclusion

The Shift Scheduler API is structured to promote maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns. Each layer has a distinct responsibility, allowing for easier testing and development. This architecture supports the core functionalities required for managing employee schedules effectively.
